### **Project Description**  

In this project, we used the **R programming language** to organize and display information about our team members as part of the **Stage Zero task** for the HackBio Biocoding Internship.  

We followed the instructions to include key details about each team member, such as:  
- Name  
- Slack username  
- Email  
- Hobby  
- Country  
- Discipline  
- Preferred programming language  

We used basic R syntax and data structures without any loops, functions, or conditionals, as per the task requirements.  

The final solution consists of a straightforward **print statement** for each team member, ensuring a well-structured and easily readable output.  

Our script has been uploaded to this GitHub repository:
